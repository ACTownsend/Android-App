#App Development Assignment 2

##Summary:
A simple reconstruction of the famous wordle game, built in .net maui.
The application allows the user to input guesses to compare against a random 5 letter word that is selected from a text file, saved in the Resources/Raw directory.
Letters in the correct location will turn green, letters that are in the word but in the incorrect location will turn yellow, and letters that are not in the word will go grey.
If the user enters a guess that is not a real word, the guess will turn red and the program will not count it as an attempt.
